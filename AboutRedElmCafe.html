        <h1>About The Cafe</h1>
        <p> We are a counter-service cafe with a small menu and friendly staff.
            Everyone is welcome at Red Elm. That means sometimes it gets noisy with kiddos in our small play area or with big meetings in our private community room. 
            Or just because all the tables are full of people having a good time.
            Our community room can seat up to 16 people and can be reserved for groups of five or more.
        </p>

        <h2>About The Sisters</h2>
        <p> 
            <div>
                JENNIFER, pictured center above, is the oldest of our siblings.
                She has drive and passion that cannot be matched. She is the owner/operator of a massage business just around the corner from Red Elm. She has lived an worked in the Hilltop for more than 15 years. 
                She is also the mom of a very smart and stubborn 14-year-old, Luke, and the Sunday school Director at Unity of South Sound.
            </div>
            <div>
                ADINA, pictured right above, is the third eldest. She is smiley and sensitive, but she also knows how to drive a semi and a forklift and run a jackhammer. 
                She’s the perfect amount of tough and tender. You’ll find her halfway through a project at all times and teaching her almost-four-year-old Oliver how to plant in the garden.
            </div>
            <div>
                SARAH, pictured left above, is the fifth eldest and youngest girl.
                She is a Jill-of-all trades, dabbling a bit in crafts, photography, writing, carpentry and now business owning. 
                She has mostly paid the bills making coffee and food, so she’s pretty stoked to be able to keep doing that and to be her own boss. She is obsessed with traveling and justice.

                We don’t think we should be the only ones making it in the world. We want to see everyone succeed. 
                That’s why we chose Caravan Coffee as the official roaster for Red Elm Cafe. 
                Caravan is committed to ethically sourcing their coffee. That means the farmers that grow the beans we love are also making it in the world.
